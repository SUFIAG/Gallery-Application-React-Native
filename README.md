# GalleryApp üñºüñºÔ∏èüñºÔ∏è

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to build a hybrid gallery collection application using JavaScript & React-Native. The application navigates through different screens. The images are fetched using an API Call. The application is compatible on various platforms like Android, iOS, and Web.
